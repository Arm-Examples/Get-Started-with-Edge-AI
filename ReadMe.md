# Get Started with Edge AI

Learn Edge AI by running real examples on your machine. Instead of reading theory, you'll actually see how model size affects speed, memory, and accuracy.

## Two Quick Examples

**[Object Detection](example_1_yolo_object_detection/)** - Compare two YOLO models. See how file size impacts performance in real-time video processing.

**[Language Model with TinyLlama](example_2_tinyllama/)** - Test a chat model with different compression levels. Watch how precision affects speed and quality.

## Why Run AI Locally?

Edge AI keeps everything on your device - no internet needed, no privacy concerns, no API costs. Plus you get instant responses.

## Getting Started

Each example includes its own setup guide and takes about 10 minutes to run. You'll quickly see the performance trade-offs that matter when deploying AI to edge devices.

Choose [object detection](example_1_yolo_object_detection/) or [language models](example_2_tinyllama/) to get started.
