# Get Started with Edge AI

Learn Edge AI by running real examples on your machine. Instead of reading theory, we'll see how model size affects speed, memory, and accuracy.

## Setup

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arm-Examples/Get-Started-with-Edge-AI.git
cd Get-Started-with-Edge-AI
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv edge-ai-env
source edge-ai-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: edge-ai-env\Scripts\activate
```

Each example has its own `requirements.txt` - install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` in each example folder.

## Quick Examples - Get Started in a few Minutes

Follow the README for each example:

**[Object Detection](example_1_yolo_object_detection/)** - Compare two YOLO models in real-time video processing.
